Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Network,Regularisation, Convolutional Neural Network with Residual Connection
Designed, implemented and evaluated an Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) system for  spoken digits using Deep Learning methods.
Extracted audio-based spectrograms from the raw .wav files of speech using digital signal processing in python.
Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) modes have been explored.
Three models have been applied $-$ first with $4$ CNN blocks with 512 filters with 69.68 percent accuracy, Second with $4$ CNN blocks with 512 filters regularised with 72.42 percent accuracy and the last one is the CNN model with Residual Connection with an outperformance of 74.64 percent. 
Demonstrated training/validation performance with visualisation during the hyperparameter optimisation in training.
Demonstrated performance using the confusion plot for each task.
